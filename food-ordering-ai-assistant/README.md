# 🍽️ AI-Powered Food Ordering System (Voice Automation)

## Overview
This automation was built to solve a real-world restaurant operations problem: handling high call volumes during peak hours without compromising order accuracy or customer experience.

During rush hours, restaurant phone lines often become overloaded—leading to missed calls, delayed orders, and frustrated customers. This system replaces manual call handling with an AI-powered voice assistant that manages food orders end-to-end.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
- Peak-hour call overload  
- Missed or incorrectly noted orders  
- Limited staff availability  
- Inconsistent customer experience  
- No after-hours call handling  

---

## 🚀 Solution
We introduced an AI voice agent that acts as a virtual order taker.

The AI:
- Answers every incoming call instantly  
- Explains the restaurant menu clearly  
- Takes customer orders through natural conversation  
- Handles item customization and delivery preferences  
- Automatically records and forwards the order to the system  

This ensures zero missed calls, faster order processing, and a consistent customer experience, even during peak hours.
